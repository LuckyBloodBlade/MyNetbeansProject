	The company Juliet was founded by the end of 2019 by Muhammad Saqif Bin 
Badlishah with a few other colleagues, Muhammad Shazrul Nazuan Bin Mohd Khairul 
Yusnizal, Syarina Arifah Binti Ramli, Juz Nur Fatiha Deena Binti Mohd Fuad, and also Nur 
Shafiqah Izzatie Binti Zainal Abidin. It is an online fashion boutique company based in Shah 
Alam, where it offers trendy and unique clothing designs for customers to buy daily 
essentials online and delivers it to the customers’ choice of delivery addresses. Since it is a 
new company, Juliet only consists of approximately 20 workers in different departments 
working together in order to provide quality services for each and every customer. 

	The difference of this company from others is we make the pricing of our products 
more affordable to our customers. Our target audience is focused more on women to buy our 
clothes because we put many clothes with variety of choice of women size and style. Our 
concept is to make sure that customers can get their clothes with an affordable price. The 
price we put is in range of RM30 to RM50 but our quality is still in brand-new condition. 

	We focus more on online based company by using online transaction and used third 
party delivery service which is PosLaju. We hope our effort will get more customer 
satisfaction as a feedback.
